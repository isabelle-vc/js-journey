<p>
    <b>Programming language:</b> a bridge that facilitates communication between computers and people
</p>
<p>
    The computer knows the selected programming language if it's archived on the computer RAM or on a disk in Binary
    code
<ul>
    <li>RAM: Random access memory</li>
    <li>Binary: a series of zeros and ones</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<ul>
    <li>Low level language: no nedd for interpretation by the computer</li>
    <li>High level language: needs to be interpreted, converted to bynary code so it can work</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>JavaScript is used to build interactivity into web pages</p>
<p>Through the years other alternatives have been created
<ul>
    <li>VBScript</li>
    <li>TypeScript</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Why use JavaScript?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Ease-of-use compared to other languages</li>
    <li>Built-in-tools on the web browser (Inspect feature)</li>
    <li>Used widely</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Plain JavaScript (aka Vanilla JavaScript)</li>
        <li>JavaSript Frameworks (React, Vue, D3)</li>
        <li>Servers (Node.js, Deno)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Acessible language for learning</li>
    <li>Wide community</li>
</ul>

<p>Jquery library woul help code in JavaScript using it's features that would work with all browsers, and considered a
    great solution to incompatibility</p>
<p>But the way people code kept evolving, bringing more problems and solutions such as React, helping creating, updating
    and maintaning complex websites</p>
<p>Many attempted the same: Knockout, Backbone, Angular, Ember, Vue, Alpine, etc</p>

<p>Legacy code: websites that still use old code from old libraries</p>

<h2>Variables</h2>

<p>[var] is used to set a valeu that is going to be reused trhough the code. When setting it I'm declaring a fact, which means a variable declaration was made</p>
<p>Setting a variable isn't enough, because it's value is still undefined. To set it use the assignment operator (=)</p>
<p>Example: var person = "John"</p>
<p style="color:lightskyblue">The use of (;) everytime at the end of a code line is best practice or required?</p>

<h2>Data types</h2>

<p><b>String</b> = text value</p>
<p>Ilimited combination of characters, must be used with single or double quotes ("",'')</p>
<p><b>Number</b> = numerical value</p>
<p>It has a wide range of possibilities, but it's limited by JavaScript calculation capabilities</p>
<p><b>Boolean</b> = true or false</p>
<p>Useful for making decisions</p>
<p><b>Null</b> = abscense of value</p>
<p><b>Undefined</b> = a variable not yet assigned a value</p>
<p><b>BigInt</b> = numerical value</p>
<p>Acomodates a much greater range of numbers than the [number] data type</p>
<p><b>Symbol</b> = unique identifier</p>
<p>Identify and individualizes elements with the same "value" like a serial number </p>

<h2>Operators</h2>

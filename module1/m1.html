    </h1>

    <p>
        <b>Programming language:</b> a bridge that facilitates communication between computers and people
    </p>
    <p>
        The computer knows the selected programming language if it's archived on the computer RAM or on a disk in Binary
        code
    <ul>
        <li>RAM: Random access memory</li>
        <li>Binary: a series of zeros and ones</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Low level language: no nedd for interpretation by the computer</li>
        <li>High level language: needs to be interpreted, converted to bynary code so it can work</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>JavaScript is used to build interactivity into web pages</p>
    <p>Through the years other alternatives have been created
    <ul>
        <li>VBScript</li>
        <li>TypeScript</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Why use JavaScript?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ease-of-use compared to other languages</li>
        <li>Built-in-tools on the web browser (Inspect feature)</li>
        <li>Used widely</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Plain JavaScript (aka Vanilla JavaScript)</li>
            <li>JavaSript Frameworks (React, Vue, D3)</li>
            <li>Servers (Node.js, Deno)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Acessible language for learning</li>
        <li>Wide community</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Jquery library woul help code in JavaScript using it's features that would work with all browsers, and considered
        a
        great solution to incompatibility</p>
    <p>But the way people code kept evolving, bringing more problems and solutions such as React, helping creating,
        updating
        and maintaning complex websites</p>
    <p>Many attempted the same: Knockout, Backbone, Angular, Ember, Vue, Alpine, etc</p>

    <p>Legacy code: websites that still use old code from old libraries</p>

    <h2>Variables</h2>

    <p>[var] is used to set a valeu that is going to be reused trhough the code. When setting it I'm declaring a fact,
        which means a variable declaration was made</p>
    <p>Setting a variable isn't enough, because it's value is still undefined. To set it use the assignment operator (=)
    </p>
    <p>Example: var person = "John"</p>
    <p style="color:lightgreen">The use of semicolon (;) everytime at the end of a code line is best practice or required?</p>
    <p style="color:lightgreen">Answer: even though the code works without it at the end, it is best practice, because as it happens at HTML documents, it helps separate the actions in the code</p>
    

    <h2>Data types</h2>

    <p><b>String</b> = text value</p>
    <p>Ilimited combination of characters, must be used with single or double quotes ("",'')</p>
    <p><b>Number</b> = numerical value</p>
    <p>It has a wide range of possibilities, but it's limited by JavaScript calculation capabilities</p>
    <p><b>Boolean</b> = true or false</p>
    <p>Useful for making decisions</p>
    <p><b>Null</b> = abscense of value</p>
    <p><b>Undefined</b> = a variable not yet assigned a value</p>
    <p><b>BigInt</b> = numerical value</p>
    <p>Acomodates a much greater range of numbers than the [number] data type</p>
    <p><b>Symbol</b> = unique identifier</p>
    <p>Identify and individualizes elements with the same "value" like a serial number </p>

        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>The comparison operators greater than (>) and less than (<) can also be used with the equal context (=)</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p>His age must be equal or greater than 18 [age >= 18]</p>
    <p>His age must be equal or less than 18 [age <= 18]</p>


    <h2>Strings</h2>

    <p> It's a collection of characters enclosed in single or double quotes</p>
    <p> ('') or ("") is known as an empty string</p>

    <h2>Booleans</h2>

    <p>Checks if a statment is true or false, which are the only two possible values as "maybe" doesn't exist in this
        case</p>
    <p> && = AND
        <br>
        console.log(true && true) will output: true
        <br>
        console.log(true && false) will output: false
        <br>
        console.log(false && true) will output: false
        <br>
        console.log(false && false) will output: false
    </p>
    <p> || = OR
        <br>
        console.log(true || true) will output: true
        <br>
        console.log(true || false) will output: true
        <br>
        console.log(false || true) will output: true
        <br>
        console.log(false || false) will output: false
    </p>
    <p> ! = NOT
        <br>
        console.log(true ! true) will output: true
        <br>
        console.log(true ! false) will output: true
        <br>
        console.log(false ! true) will output: true
        <br>
        console.log(false ! false) will output: false
    </p>
    <p>Concatenation operator uses the same symbol as Addition operator (+), but the concatenation is when it's used
        with strings</p>
    <p>
        Example: [console.log (365 + "days")]
        <br>
        In this case the JS convertes the number value into a string value so that it can run the (+) operator
        <br>
        This process is called "coercion"
        <br>
        Sometimes it can show an unexpected result
        <br>
        Example: [console.log (1 + "2")]
        <br>
        If this happens, the number value will be transformed into a string value and the result will be "12" and not
        the addition operation
    </p>
    <p>
        += as Addition assignment operator
        <br>
        It's used when one wants to accumulate the values stored in a variable
    </p>
    <p>
        Operator precedence and associativity
        <br>
        Precedence considers the math logic of operations where, the multiplication and division are calculated first
        than addition and Subtraction
        <br>
        Associativity determines how the precedence works when the code uses operators with the same precedence
        <br>
        Example: [5 > 4 > 3]
        <br>
        The [5 > 4] is evaluated first (to `true`), then true > 3 is evaluated to `false`, because the `true` value is
        coerced to `1`
    </p>

    <h2>Statements</h2>
    
    <p>The <b>if statement</b> checks a condition and will execute a code block if the condition is met or true</p>
    <p>Generally, if else is better suited if there is a binary choice in the condition</p>
    <p>Operators usually used are == , > , < ,!= </p>
    <p>The <b>if-else statement</b> handles both outcomes of the conditional reques </p>
    <p>It's possible to test multiple conditions usign a additional block for an <b>else-if statement</b> </p>
    
    <h2>Switch statements</h2>
    
    <p>if there are a lot of possible outcomes, it is best practice to use a <b>switch statement</b> because it is easier to read</p>
    
    <h2>Looping</h2>

    <p>Used for repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is satisfied</p>
    <p>Incrementer or loop counter, represented by the letter "i" in programming, without it the loop doesn't when to start or end, which is a infinite loop</p>
    
    <p>Types of loops</p>
    <p>For: loop a block of code a certain number of times </p>
    <p>Set the value: [var i = 0]</p>
    <p>Specify the condition: [i < 3] (the end-count value)</p>
    <p>Increment the counter: [i++] (increase or decrease) </p>

    <p>While: loop a block of code a certain number of times too</p>
    <p>Set the value: [var i = 0] before the loop</p>
    <p>Specify the condition: [(i < 3)] is set outside of the loop (the end-count value), and if the information is true, it will run the loop</p>
    <p>Increment the counter: [i=i+1] (increase or decrease) is set inside the loop's body</p>
    <p>The [i++] means the same as [i=i+1]</p>
    
    <p>Nested: process more than one data at the same time</p>
    <p>In this cases exists the outer loops and the inner loops</p>
    <p>Be careful with the use of loops, as multiple levels of nested loops will slow the code</p>
